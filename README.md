I am building a new website while learning Node.js, Express, Pug.

Using Nodemon:

To update your application live on your local dev server install, Nodemon. Nodemon is a utility that automatically restarts your development server as you make live changes to your application.

Run `npm start` in your project directory to run the Nodemon utility.

Pug:

Pug is a handy template engine for the Express framework. Pug compiles into HTML and can render data to the client.

Very similar to Ruby, Pug utilizes a view folder that contains your templates. You can create your template inside of the view and render your view into your node.js file.
