I am building a new website while learning Node.js and Express.

Using Nodemon:

To update your application live on your local dev server install, Nodemon. Nodemon is a utility that automatically restarts your development server as you make live changes to your application.

Run `npm start` in your project directory to run the Nodemon utility.
